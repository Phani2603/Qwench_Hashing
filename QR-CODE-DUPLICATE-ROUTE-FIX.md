# QR Code Duplicate Route Fix

## Issue Identified
Found duplicate route definitions in `backend/routes/qrcode.js` that were causing routing conflicts:

- **Line 76**: First `/scan/:codeId` route (public route, correctly positioned)
- **Line 270**: Duplicate `/scan/:codeId` route (removed)

## Root Cause
Express.js route matching works on a "first match wins" basis. Having duplicate routes can cause:
1. Unpredictable behavior 
2. The first route always being matched
3. Potential conflicts in route handling

## Solution Applied
âœ… **Removed duplicate scan route** (lines 270-344) from `backend/routes/qrcode.js`
âœ… **Kept original route structure** with public routes at the top
âœ… **Verified no syntax errors** after removal

## Current Route Structure (Correct)
```javascript
// ========= PUBLIC ROUTES FIRST (NO AUTHENTICATION) =========

// 1. Verify QR code (public route) - Line 27
router.get("/verify/:codeId", async (req, res) => { ... })

// 2. Scan QR code and redirect (public route) - Line 76  
router.get("/scan/:codeId", async (req, res) => { ... })

// ========= AUTHENTICATED ROUTES =========
// All other routes requiring authentication...
```

## Verification Steps
1. âœ… Confirmed only one `/verify/:codeId` route exists (line 27)
2. âœ… Confirmed only one `/scan/:codeId` route exists (line 76)
3. âœ… No syntax errors in the file
4. ðŸ”„ **Next**: Commit and deploy to test functionality

## Next Actions Required
1. **Commit changes** to git repository
2. **Push to Railway** to trigger deployment
3. **Test QR verification** functionality
4. **Monitor logs** for any routing issues

## Files Modified
- `backend/routes/qrcode.js` - Removed duplicate scan route (lines 270-344)
