# 🔍 QR Code Download Feature Documentation

## ✨ Feature Overview

A new high-quality QR code download feature has been added to the admin dashboard, allowing administrators to download high-resolution (600x600px) PNG versions of QR codes.

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Backend
- Added new API endpoint: `GET /api/qrcodes/download/:codeId`
- Endpoint is authentication-protected
- Generates high-quality 600x600px PNG QR codes on demand
- Sets proper HTTP headers for file download
- Includes audit logging for download actions

### Frontend
- Added download functionality in the QR code management dashboard
- Implemented direct file download via fetch API
- Shows loading and success/error messages
- Automatically names downloaded files using the pattern: `QRCode-{websiteTitle}-{codeId}.png`

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard → QR Code Management
2. Find the QR code you want to download
3. Click the View button
4. In the QR code dialog, click "Download High-Quality PNG"
5. The browser will automatically download the high-resolution QR code image

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Backend Endpoint
```javascript
router.get("/download/:codeId", authenticate, async (req, res) => {
  // Finds QR code and generates high-quality version
  // Sets headers for file download and sends buffer
});
```

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
const downloadQRCode = (qr: QRCode) => {
  // Fetches high-quality QR code with auth headers
  // Creates downloadable link from response blob
  // Triggers browser download
};
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Endpoint requires authentication
- Only authorized users can download QR codes
- Download activity is logged for audit purposes
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
