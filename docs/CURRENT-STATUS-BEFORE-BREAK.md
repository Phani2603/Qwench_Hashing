# CURRENT STATUS - BEFORE BREAK
**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Time**: Before 6 PM break  
**Resume**: After 6 PM  

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE TO FIX
**GridFS Crash Bug** - QR code generation fails with 502 errors

### Problem Location
File: `backend/utils/gridfs.js`  
Line: ~47 (finish event handler)

### Root Cause
```javascript
// CURRENT BUGGY CODE:
uploadStream.on('finish', (file) => {
  console.log(`QR code stored in MongoDB with ID: ${file._id}`);
  // ERROR: 'file' parameter is undefined, causing TypeError on file._id
});
```

### Required Fix
```javascript
// CORRECT CODE:
uploadStream.on('finish', () => {
  const fileId = uploadStream.id; // Use uploadStream.id instead
  console.log(`QR code stored in MongoDB with ID: ${fileId}`);
  // Rest of the code should use fileId instead of file._id
});
```

## 📋 CURRENT PROJECT STATUS
