# QR Code Verification Route Fix

## Issue
Requests to `/api/qrcodes/verify/:codeId` endpoint were failing with "Route not found" errors despite the route being defined in the codebase.

## Root Cause
In Express.js, route order matters. Routes are matched in the order they are defined. The QR verification route was defined at the end of the file, causing Express to match other parameter routes first.

## Solution
1. Moved the public routes (verification and scan) to the top of the `qrcode.js` file for proper route matching
2. Added clear comments about the importance of route order in Express.js
3. Removed duplicate route definitions that could cause conflicts
4. Organized routes logically with public routes first, then authenticated routes

## Changes Made
- Modified `backend/routes/qrcode.js` to fix the route order issue
- Added important comments about route order

## Testing
After deployment, verify that QR code verification now works by:
1. Scanning a QR code
2. Accessing the verification endpoint directly: `/api/qrcodes/verify/:codeId`
3. Testing the frontend verification page

## Best Practices for Express Routes
1. Define specific routes before pattern-matching routes
2. Group routes by authentication requirements (public routes first)
3. Use proper route organization to avoid conflicts
4. Add clear comments about route order when necessary
